- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
      - SessionStart hook that auto-detects PolicyEngine repos and injects instructions to use specialized plugin agents (rules-engineer, ci-fixer, pr-pusher, etc.) instead of general-purpose agents
    changed:
      - "Update pr-pusher, rules-engineer, and ci-fixer agents to use `uv run black` instead of bare `black` command to ensure version matches uv.lock and CI"
      - "Add explicit guidance about using `uv sync --extra dev` before formatting to ensure correct tool versions"
