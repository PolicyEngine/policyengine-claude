      - "**fix-pr command rewritten** - Now 5 phases with dependency-order fixing (parameters → variables → tests → format), clear issue-to-agent mapping"
      - "**encode-policy continuous regulatory verification** - Added 3 checkpoints: after Phase 2 (specification review), after 3A (parameter verification), after 3C (logic review)"
