    changed:
      - Slim down backdate-program prep agents to prevent context blowouts — prep now only downloads, renders, and reports page count (no page mapping or full text extraction)
      - Add self-mapping step to research agents — each agent identifies sections within its assigned page range before extracting values
      - Add structured research agent prompt template with TOC hint passthrough from prep
